#### Description: 

Hello, My name is Eamon Wong, and I am from Glasgow, Scotland.

The TODO-App is a task managing Web-Application to help its users to stay organised for their day-to-day activities.

The Todo-App can be used for multiple purposes such as shopping lists, taking notes or planning an event.

A user may add to the TODO task list, and view all the tasks they have to complete. If the task is completed, users can just click on the "Done" button next to the task, after clicking it will show as completed. Completed tasks can be deleted by the "Delete" button, however, users can have the option to leave the task alone. But, if the user tries to add a task without writing anything, the screen will come up as an error. Users can go back to fix this issue.
